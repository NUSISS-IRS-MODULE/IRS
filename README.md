# Intelligent Reasoning Systems (IRS)

Welcome to the Intelligent Reasoning Systems (IRS) repository! This project aims to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate intelligent reasoning algorithms and systems for various applications.

## Overview

Intelligent Reasoning Systems leverage AI techniques such as logic, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning to solve complex problems, make decisions, and infer knowledge from data.

## Features

- Modular architecture for reasoning components
- Support for multiple reasoning paradigms (e.g., rule-based, probabilistic, hybrid)
- Extensible framework for integrating new algorithms
- Example applications and datasets

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NUSISS-IRS-MODULE/IRS.git
   cd IRS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - (Add instructions here for installing required packages, e.g., Python, pip, etc.)

3. **Run sample code:**
   - (Add instructions for running a demo or main script)
